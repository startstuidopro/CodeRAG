    "\n",
    "We want to compute the embeddings for all the chunks of our knowledge base: to learn more about sentence embeddings, we recommend reading [this guide](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/sentence_embeddings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does retrieval work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the chunks are all embedded, we store them in a vector database. When the user types in a query, it gets embedded by the same model previously used, and a similarity search returns the closest documents from the vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical challenge is thus, given a query vector, to quickly find the nearest neighbors of this vector in the vector database. To do this, we need to choose two things: a distance, and a search algorithm to find the nearest neighbors quickly within a database of thousands of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Nearest Neighbor search algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plentiful choices for the nearest neighbor search algorithm: we go with Facebook's [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) since FAISS is performant enough for most use cases, and it is well known and thus widely implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distances\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding distances, you can find a good guide [here](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/sentence_embeddings/#distance-between-embeddings). In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosine similarity** computes the similarity between two vectors as the cosinus of their relative angle: it allows us to compare vector directions regardless of their magnitude. Using it requires normalizing all vectors, to rescale them into unit norm.\n",
    "- **Dot product** takes into account magnitude, with the sometimes undesirable effect that increasing a vector's length will make it more similar to all others.\n",
    "- **Euclidean distance** is the distance between the ends of vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try [this small exercise](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/similarity/check-your-understanding) to check your understanding of these concepts. But once vectors are normalized, [the choice of a specific distance does not matter much](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/which-distance-function-should-i-use).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our particular model works well with cosine similarity, so choose this distance, and we set it up both in the Embedding model, and in the `distance_strategy` argument of our FAISS index. With cosine similarity, we have to normalize our embeddings.\n",
